# 🎮 Andypolis

A turn-based strategy game for two players, developed as a final project for **Algorithms and Programming II (95.14)** at FIUBA. Players compete to fulfill objectives by navigating a grid, collecting resources, and constructing buildings while strategically sabotaging their opponent.

# 📝 Description
The project focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++, emphasizing memory management and the implementation of custom data structures to handle the map, player inventories, and building types.

## 🧩 Key Features
- **Grid-Based Navigation:** A dynamic map loaded from text files where players move and interact.
- **Resource Economy:** Collect materials (wood, stone, metal) to fund construction.
- **Building System:** Unique properties for each structure type.
- **Strategic Sabotage:** Specialized resources to hinder the opponent's progress.
- **Objective-Driven:** Multiple paths to victory based on specific game goals.

## 🛠️ Technologies
* Language: C++
* Build Tool: GNU Make
* Memory Debugging: Valgrind
* Standard: C++11 or higher

# 🚀 Getting Started
## 📋 Prerequisites
* A C++ compiler (GCC/G++ recommended).
* `make` utility installed.
* (Optional) `valgrind` for memory leak checks.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:SebaB29/andypolis.git
  cd andypolis
  ```
2. Compile the project:
  ```bash
  make main
  ```
3. Run the game:
  ```bash
  ./andypolis
  ```
4. Run with Valgrind (Memory Check):
  ```bash
  make valgrind
  ```
⚠️ Important: Ensure the folder `archivos_de_texto/` contains the files `materiales.txt`, `ubicaciones.txt`, `edificios.txt`, and `mapa.txt` for the game to initialize correctly.

# 🎮 Gameplay
Players take turns performing actions:
* **Move**: Navigate through the coordinates of the map.
* **Build**: Spend collected materials to place structures.
* **Collect**: Gather spawned resources from the grid.
* **Attack**: Use sabotage mechanics to gain an advantage.
